Algorithm:
step 1: start the program
step 2: import all required libraries
step 3:import all distraction class folders(c0-c9)
step 4: see the popularity of each class
step 5: build a cnn model
	Input → Convolution layer → Batch normalization → Convolution layer 
              →  Batch Normalization → Maxpooling → Dropout → Convolution layer
              →    Batch normalization →Convolution layer →Batch Normalization
              →Maxpooling → Dropout → Convolution layer → Batch normalization 
               →Convolution layer → Batch Normalization → Maxpooling →
         Dropout → Flatten → Dense → Batch Normalization → Dropout →    
         Dense→Dropout →Dense → Output.
step 6: train the model with 80% of images from each distraction class
step 7: test the model the tghge testing sample images
step 8: see the learning curve
step 9: if the probalibily of the image to its corresponding distraction class is satisfactory then safe the model.
step 10: stop the program.
